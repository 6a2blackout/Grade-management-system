🎓 Grade Management System

Collaborated with a peer to develop a command-line Grade Management System using C, designed to help university professors manage student records and class performance. This project was built as part of a course assignment and followed an Agile development approach with iterative planning and implementation.

🚀 Features
- Student Record Management: Add, view, and manage student information seamlessly.
- Grade Entry & Updates: Input and modify grades with ease.
- Data Import/Export: Handle student data through text files, facilitating integration with other systems.
- Makefile Integration: Simplify compilation and execution using provided Makefiles.
- Future-Ready Design: Structured to accommodate future enhancements, including GUI development.


🛠️ Technologies Used
C Language:
- Core programming language for application logic.
Makefile:
- Automates the build process for ease of compilation.

📚 What I Learned
- File Handling in C: Reading from and writing to text files for data persistence.
- Modular Programming: Organizing code into separate files for better maintainability.
- Command-Line Interface Design: Creating user-friendly text-based interfaces.
- Build Automation: Utilizing Makefiles to streamline the compilation process.
